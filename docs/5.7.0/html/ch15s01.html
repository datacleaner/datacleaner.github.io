		<p>Apache Hadoop is a distributed system with a number of key components of which a few are important to understand:</p>
		<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>YARN</em></span>, which is often referred to as the 'operating system' of Hadoop. YARN is the managing entity which assigns resources to running a specific job or task.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>HDFS</em></span>, which is the Hadoop Distributed File System. This is the location where data is located, but also the place where executables are often shared so that a distributed process can be picked up on many nodes in the cluster.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Namenode</em></span>, is a dedicated node in the cluster which deals with HDFS and distribution of data to other nodes, so-called datanodes.
				</p>
			</li></ol></div>
		<p>In addition, the DataCleaner Hadoop support is built using Apache Spark, which is a data processing framework that works with Hadoop as well as other clustering technologies. A few important concepts of Apache Spark are useful to understand for DataCleaner's deployment on Hadoop:</p>
		<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Cluster manager</em></span>, which is the component that negotiates with the cluster - for instance Hadoop/YARN. From the perspective of Apache Spark, YARN is a <span class="emphasis"><em>cluster manager</em></span>.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Driver program</em></span>, which is the program that directs the cluster manager and tells it what to do. In Apache Spark for Hadoop you have two choices: To run the Driver program as an external process ('yarn-client') or to run the Driver program as a process inside YARN itself ('yarn-cluster').
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Executor</em></span>, which is a node in a Spark cluster that executes a partition (chunk) of a job.
				</p>
			</li></ol></div>
		<p>In the top-part of the below image you see Hadoop/YARN as well as Apache Spark, and how they are componentized.</p>
		<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="hadoop_deployment_overview.png"></span>
		<p>In the lower part of the image you see DataCleaner's directory structure on HDFS. As you can see, the usual configuration and job files are used, but placed on HDFS. A special JAR file is placed on HDFS to act as executable for the Apache Spark executors.</p>
