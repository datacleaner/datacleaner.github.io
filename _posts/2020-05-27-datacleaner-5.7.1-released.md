We're happy to announce the release of DataCleaner version 5.7.1. This release is a minor update that addresses a couple of issues and improvements primarily found in libraries and other systems that we depend on.

```
#1849 - Fixed compatibility with recent versions of PostgreSQL.
#1825 - Improved error messages when JDBC connection is failing
Upgraded several dependencies, incl. Apache MetaModel, Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Jackson and Scala.
```

You can get the new version on the [Downloads page](/downloads).
