		<p>Master data management (MDM) is a very broad term and is seen
			materialized in a variety of ways. For the scope of this document it
			serves more as a context of data quality than an activity that we
			actually target with DataCleaner per-se.
		</p>
		<p>The overall goals of MDM is to manage the important data of an
			organization. By "master data" we refer to "a single version of the
			truth", ie. not the data of a particular system, but for example all
			the customer data or product data of a company. Usually this data is
			dispersed over
			multiple datastores, so an important part of MDM
			is the
			process of unifying the data into a single model.
		</p>
		<p>Obviously another of the very important issues to handle in MDM
			is
			the quality of data. If you simply gather eg. "all customer data"
			from all systems in an organization, you will most likely see a lot
			of data quality issues. There will be a lot of duplicate entries,
			there will be variances in the way that customer data is filled,
			there will be different identifiers and even different levels of
			granularity for defining "what is a customer?". In the context of
			MDM, DataCleaner can serve as the engine to cleanse, transform and
			unify data from multiple datastores into the single view of the
			master data.
