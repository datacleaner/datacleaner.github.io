		<p>The way DataCleaner processes data is
			slightly different compared
			to most similar (ETL-like) tools. Firstly in the way multithreading
			is applied, secondly in the way DataCleaner may sometimes optimize
			the graph at execution time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="emphasis"><em>Multithreading:</em></span>
			The multithreading strategy in DataCleaner enables the tool to have
			the minimum amount of blocking and buffering and the maximum amount
			of parallelism and potentially also distribution. Most ETL-like tools
			apply a threading strategy where each component in a job has its own
			thread-management as well as an input- and an output-buffer. In
			DataCleaner the thread management is made such that every record is
			processed in parallel - each unit of work is stepping through the
			complete job graph in one single pass. This has a number of
			interesting traits:
		</p>
		<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
				<p>There is a high degree of automatic 'load balancing' among
					the components - less constraints and bottlenecks around the
					slowest components in the job.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>The system lends itself to highly distributed processing
					because statefulness is the exception instead of the
					rule.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>There is less waste in the form of buffers inbetween the
					components of a job.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>One downside to this approach is that the order of the
					processed records cannot be guaranteed. This is only very rarely
					required in the domain of data profiling and analysis, and if it is
					required there are technical workarounds to apply.
				</p>

			<span class="emphasis"><em>Graph optimization:</em></span>
			While a job graph (see
			<a class="link" href="ch02s04.html" title="Wiring components together">wiring components together</a>
			) may show a particular following order, the engine may at runtime do
			certain optimizations to it. Some components may provide optimization
			strategies that involves changing the source query so that the number
			of (or content of) processed records is changed. Obviously this is a
			side-effect of using a component that will only be applied in cases
			where it does not impact other components in a job. The principle is
			sometimes also referred to as 'Push down optimization'.
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of this is a 'Null check' filter: If a Null check is
			applied on a source column and all other components require either a
			NULL or a NOT_NULL outcome (either explicitly or implicitly), then
			the 'Null check' filter may add a predicate to the source query to
			filter out all irrelevant records. For more information on this
			principle, please read the blog entry '
