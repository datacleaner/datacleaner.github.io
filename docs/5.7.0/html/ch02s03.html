		<p>There are a few different kinds of components that you can add
			to your
			job:
		</p>
		<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Analyzers</em></span>
					, which are the most important components. Actually, without at
					least one analyzer the job will not run (if you execute the job
					without adding one, DataCleaner will suggest adding a basic one
					that will save the output to a file). An analyzer is a component
					that inspects the data that it receives and generates a result or a
					report. The majority of the data profiling cruft is created as
					analyzers.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Transformers</em></span>
					are components used to modify the data before analyzing it.
					Sometimes it's neccessary to extract parts of a value or combine
					two
					values to correctly get an idea about a particular measure. In
					other scenarios, transformers can be used to perform reference data
					lookups or other similar tasks and place the results of an
					operation into the stream of data in the job.
				</p>
				<p>
					The result of a transformer is a set of output columns. These
					columns work exactly like regular columns in your job, except that
					they have a preceding step in the flow before they become
					materialized.
				</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Filters</em></span>
					are components that split the flow of processing in a job. A filter
					will have a number of possible outcomes and depending on the
					outcome of a filter, a particular row might be processed by
					different sub-flows. Filters are often used simply to disregard
					certain rows from the analysis, eg. null values or values outside
					the range of interest.
				</p>
			</li></ol></div>
		<p>Each of these
			components will be presented as a node in the job
			graph. Double-clicking a component (graph node) will bring its
			configuration dialog.
		</p>
		<p>
			Transformers and filters are added to your job using the "Transform"
			and "Improve"
			menus. The menus are available in component library on the left
			or by right-clicking on an empty space in the canvas.
			Please refer to
			the reference chapter
			<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Transform">Transformations</a>
			for more
			information on specific transformers and filters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Analyzers are added to your job using the "Analyze" menu (in most
			cases), but also "Write" menu for analyzers that save output to a
			datastore. Please
			refer to the reference chapter
			<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Analyze">Analyzers</a>
			for more
			information on specific analyzers.
