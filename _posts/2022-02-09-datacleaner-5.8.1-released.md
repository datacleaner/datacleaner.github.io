Hello DataCleaner community! It has been over a year since our last release, but we finally have exciting news to share. DataCleaner version 5.8.1 has just been made available!

The main news to share is that DataCleaner now runs on all the latest version of Java, which required us to do a whole lot of modernizing of the platform that the application is built on. A total of more than 20 libraries have been updated and fitted to work with the latest Java runtimes.

In addition to this critical work, we've also rewired the RegexSwap catalog of regular expressions that you can use. The old RegexSwap web services had been defunct for a while, but with a new API endpoint that is controlled by the community, we're online with reusable regular expressions again!

You can get DataCleaner version 5.8.1 on the [Downloads page](/downloads)!
